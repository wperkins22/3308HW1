        <h1>Perkins, Wyatt</h1>
        <p>I have been on two sea kayaking trips, one for 9 days and the other for 14 days. I had to get shoulder repair surgery after being
          injured while playing lacrosse. I have never seen the movie Titanic. I'm studying computer science because technology is very interesting
          to me and, ever since my first coding class freshman year, I have loved studying it.</p>
